    <br><br/> <br><br/>Bringing meaning back to the phrase “neighborhood bar," The Garage on Motor Ave has become a second home for Angelenos. Whether you're a regular or a first-timer, you'll be treated like part of our community. <br><br/> Our bartender can often be seen shooting the breeze with the locals, and makes a point to learn each of their names and favorite drinks. <br><br/> It's this laid back vibe that keeps our regulars coming back week after week. With an extensive selection of craft beers on tap, as well as a crave-worthy food selection, we’ve got you covered. <br><br/> So relax on our patio or watch your favorite team every Sunday on one of our 28 HD TVs. <br><br/> We’ll save you a seat!

L.A.'s neighborhood bar, featuring craft beer, live sports, and good times.
<br><br/>
The Garage featuring The Motor Club is the newest destination in Palms. It is a fusion of sports bar and neighborhood pub that aims to bring an upscale but unpretentious atmosphere to its part of L.A. The space has been transformed into two strikingly different dining room and bar areas, which, while they contrast in feel and aesthetic the two share a thoughtful menu that aims to bring a little enlightenment to casual, bar-style dining.
<br><br/>
The Garage is a haven for sports fans who long for a place to watch their favorite team that challenges the predictability of most sports bars. Over a dozen HD TVs adorn the walls, with total coverage of all sports available in the region. And if you like the sunshine, the bright and airy Garage transitions out to a large patio where you can sip your North Coast Sculpin IPA and dig into some Lobster Roll Sliders in front of five more TVs.
<br><br/>
The Motor Club, with a mellow lighting and rich, brown wood interior offers a relaxed alternative to the impassioned sports fans in The Garage. With the feel of a old-town pub, The Motor Club will offer hand crafted cocktails, an extensive spirits list and the perfect environment to enjoy good company.
