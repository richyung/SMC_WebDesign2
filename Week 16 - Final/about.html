      <h2>Our Story </h2>
      <p>Until Freedom is an intersectional social justice organization rooted in the leadership of diverse people of color to address systemic and racial injustice. <br> 
        <br> At Until Freedom, we believe that those closest to the pain are closest to the solution, therefore, we focus on investing in those who are the most directly impacted by cyclical poverty, inequality, and state violence. <br>
        <br> We are a clearinghouse for advocates, new & budding activists, seasoned community organizers, students, movement lawyers, entertainers and artists, policy experts, formerly & currently incarcerated individuals, and survivors of gun violence to work linearly to uplift all of our people.<br>
        <br> Everyone is worthy, everyone is needed to win.
